/**
 * Utility interface for handling unsigned 64-bit integer (long) values in Java.
 * <p>
 * Java's {@code long} primitive type is signed.  When you need to treat a {@code long} as unsigned,
 * especially for operations like division, remainder, comparison, and string conversion, you need
 * to use specific methods provided by the {@link Long} class. This interface provides static methods
 * that encapsulate these unsigned operations, making it easier to work with unsigned longs.
 * <p>
 * The following points are important to remember when working with unsigned longs in Java:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Java represents {@code long} as a signed 64-bit two's complement integer.</li>
 *     <li>When interpreting a {@code long} as unsigned, the range shifts from
 *         {@code -2^63} to {@code 2^63 - 1} (signed) to {@code 0} to {@code 2^64 - 1} (unsigned).</li>
 *     <li>Values that are negative when interpreted as signed longs become very large positive values
 *         when interpreted as unsigned longs. For example, {@code -1L} (signed) is {@code 2^64 - 1} (unsigned).</li>
 *     <li>Java provides methods in the {@link Long} class (like {@link Long#divideUnsigned},
 *         {@link Long#compareUnsigned}, {@link Long#toUnsignedString}, etc.) to perform operations
 *         treating {@code long} values as unsigned.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This interface aims to group these utility methods for cleaner and more organized code when
 * dealing with unsigned long values.
